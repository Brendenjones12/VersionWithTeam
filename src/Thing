This summer I worked as a IT and Project Intern for United Animal Health in Sheridan Indiana. My main 
responsabilities where to sit through different meetings with my boss and learn about all the projects 
the company was trying to finish. I was assignmed a few projects that where in the companies data warehouse and I 
used visual studio a lot to fix an application that was not working right. Once I was finished with my internship I 
worked part time making feed for the company i Interned with.
